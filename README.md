# **Newzzy : A News App**

This document outlines the functionality and technical aspects of a news application built using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and the News API.

> ### **Project Description :**

This news application allows users to explore and discover news articles from various sources. It utilizes the News API to retrieve news data based on user preferences and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

> ### **Technologies Used :**

* **Frontend:** React.js
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **News Data:** News API (Free Version)

> ### **Features :**

* **Category-wise News:** Users can browse news articles categorized based on their interests. 
* **Search Functionality:** Users can search for specific news articles using keywords. (Potentially)
* **User Interface:** The application utilizes Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive design.

> ### **Technical Details :**

* **React.js:** The application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React components manage the application state and render the UI based on user interactions.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS provides utility classes for styling the application components. This allows for rapid development and a consistent design throughout the application.
* **News API:** The free version of the News API is used to fetch news articles. Users can filter articles by keywords, category, language, and source. (Paid plans offer additional features and remove limitations)

> ### **Deployment Limitations :**

Unfortunately, due to limitations of the free tier News API plan, the application is not currently deployed. The free tier restricts access to news data unless the application is running on a local development server (localhost). Upgrading to a paid News API plan would allow for deployment to a public server.

> ### **Future Considerations :**

* **Deployment:** Upgrading to a paid News API plan would enable deployment to a public server, making the application accessible to a wider audience.
* **Authentication:** Implementing user authentication would allow for personalized news recommendations and potentially saved articles.
* **Advanced Search:** Implementing a more advanced search functionality would allow users to filter articles by date, source, and other criteria.

> ### **Conclusion :**

This news application demonstrates the use of React.js, Tailwind CSS, and the News API to create a user-friendly platform for exploring news articles. While deployment is currently limited due to the free tier API restrictions, the application has a strong foundation for further development and deployment with a paid API plan.
